# DataSecurity


## Intro

Example of encrypting/decrypting data through an API using express.


## Run locally

Install dependencies for server

npm install

Sudo (to override permissions)

## Run the Express server only
npm run start:dev

## Notes

  This app uses MongoDb AWS so there is no need to change the uri

#TODO

  -- return empty array if enc key is incorrect
  -- deeper tests
  -- tests against garbage data

## Server runs on http://localhost:8000
